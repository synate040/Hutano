## ðŸ“š Professional Academic Documentation for Hospital Resource Forecasting

This guide provides you with professional academic-style documentation and figures for your HUTANO system, exactly like the example you showed with code outputs and figure references.

## ðŸŽ¯ Generated Figures

All figures have been generated in the `hutano_documentation_figures/` directory:

### Figure 3.1: Missing Values Analysis - HUTANO System
**File:** `figure_3_1_missing_values.png`

**Academic Text to Include:**
```
3.4.4.1 Checking Missing Values

A preliminary check using the Pandas function df.isnull().sum() revealed that no missing values
were present in any columns. This was verified through the following code cell in the notebook
shown in Figure 3.1 below:

# Check for missing values
print('Missing Values:')
print(df.isnull().sum())
print('\nUnique values in categorical columns:')
print('Gender unique values:')
print(df['gender'].unique())

Missing Values:

models. The hexadecimal forms ensuring space and readability. Age classification was made
broader while ensuring that sensitive continuous variables could not aid in re-identification.

**Academic Text to Include:**
```
3.4.4.3 Prophet Data Preparation

Data was specifically formatted for Prophet model requirements, ensuring proper
column naming and temporal ordering as shown in Figure 3.3:

def prepare_prophet_data(df, date_col, value_col):
    """
    Prepare data for Prophet forecasting model
    Prophet requires columns named 'ds' (datestamp) and 'y' (value)
    """
    prophet_df = df[[date_col, value_col]].copy()
    prophet_df.columns = ['ds', 'y']
    prophet_df = prophet_df.sort_values('ds')
    prophet_df = prophet_df.dropna()
    return prophet_df
